# my_first_php
This is my first ever php project. I learned how to declare a variable, work with arrays, and run a php project with terminal and a browser.

## Setup
- Download this repo.
- Navigate to the root of the project in terminal.
- Run this line in terminal: `php -S localhost:8000`
- On your browser, enter this in the url bar: `http://localhost:8000`
